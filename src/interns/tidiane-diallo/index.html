            Software Engineer with a focus on front-end
          </h4>
          <p>
           I am excited to work on modern technical structure, learn from experienced software engineers about everything from API optimization to developing API's and working on product where security is a focal point etc....
           What make me want to be a software engineer are:
           First: the fulfillment at the end of the tunnel when you create or contribute on making a software works.
           Second: the passion of being able to contribute into something you know have meaning to the world and help it move it in a better direction.
           Another reason that is quite important to me is representing my community and show that it is possible for everyone of us to push through and become engineer.
           All in all, I am ready to be like a spounge and learn, grow and challenge myself to be the best software engineer I can be.
